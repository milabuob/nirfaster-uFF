Welcome to NIRFASTerUFF's documentation!
=======================================
NIRFAST was originally developed in 2001 as a MATLAB-based package used to model near-infrared light propagation through tissue and reconstruct images of optical biomarkers. At its core, NIRFAST is tool that does finite element modeling of the medium in which the light progagates, and calculates the fluence field by solving the diffusion equation.

A fully overhauled version, titled NIRFASTer, was published in 2018, thanks to the work of Dr. Stanis≈Çaw Wojtkiewicz. In the new version, GPU support was added to the key algorithms, giving the software a dramatic boost in performance. The CPU versions of the algorithms were re-implemented in C++ with multithreading enabled, and the performance was improved considerably.

In this version, now titled NIRFASTerFF (Fast and Furious), the entire toolbox is re-written with Python as its interfacing language, while fully inter-operatable with the original Matlab version. The algorithms, running on both GPU and CPU, are yet again improved for even better performance. This is the compact, aka micro version of the NIRFASTerFF package.

This manual is a detailed documentation of all APIs in the package. Please also refer to the demos to see how the package is used in difference applications.
